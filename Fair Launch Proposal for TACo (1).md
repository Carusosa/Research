# Fair Launch Proposal for TACo

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a fair launch strategy for TACo (Threshold Access Control) as it transitions from being part of the Threshold Network to an independent protocol with its own token. Drawing inspiration from NuCypher's WorkLock mechanism and incorporating modern fair launch principles, this proposal aims to create a token distribution that is equitable, community-aligned, and supports the long-term success of TACo as a decentralized access control network.

## Core Principles

The TACo fair launch will be guided by the following principles:

1. **Broad Distribution**: Ensuring tokens are widely distributed to prevent centralization
2. **Aligned Incentives**: Requiring participants to demonstrate commitment to the network
3. **Recognition of Existing Stakeholders**: Acknowledging those who have supported TACo's development
4. **Technical Merit**: Prioritizing distribution to those who will contribute to network security and operations
5. **Transparency**: Clear communication and documentation of all launch parameters
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Structuring the launch to minimize regulatory concerns

## Token Distribution Model: TACo WorkLock 2.0

Building on NuCypher's successful WorkLock mechanism while incorporating modern improvements, I propose a "WorkLock 2.0" model with the following components:

### 1. Initial Token Allocation (100%)

- **Node Operator Allocation (40%)**: Distributed through the WorkLock 2.0 mechanism
- **Threshold Network Stakeholder Allocation (20%)**: For existing T token holders
- **Community Development Fund (15%)**: For grants, bounties, and ecosystem growth
- **Core Development Team (15%)**: For ongoing development with 3-year vesting
- **Strategic Partners and Integrations (5%)**: For key partnerships and integrations
- **Initial Liquidity Provision (5%)**: For establishing market liquidity

### 2. WorkLock 2.0 Mechanism (40% of supply)

The WorkLock 2.0 mechanism will distribute tokens to node operators who demonstrate commitment to running TACo infrastructure:

**Key Features:**
- Participants stake ETH in a smart contract to receive TACo tokens
- The staked ETH is fully refundable after a minimum operational period (6 months)
- Participants must run a TACo node meeting minimum performance requirements
- Token allocation is proportional to ETH staked, with minimum and maximum caps
- Slashing conditions apply for malicious behavior or extended downtime

**Improvements over Original WorkLock:**
- Tiered minimum requirements to allow smaller participants
- Performance-based bonus allocations for high-quality infrastructure
- Option for delegated staking to technical operators
- Gradual token unlocking based on operational milestones

### 3. Threshold Network Stakeholder Allocation (20% of supply)

To recognize the contribution of Threshold Network stakeholders to TACo's development:

- Snapshot of T token holders at a pre-announced date
- Allocation proportional to T tokens held, with bonus for staked tokens
- Additional allocation for those who have integrated with or used TACo services
- 3-month cliff followed by 9-month linear vesting to prevent immediate selling

### 4. Community Development Fund (15% of supply)

A DAO-governed fund to support the TACo ecosystem:

- Initial focus on developer grants and educational resources
- Bug bounty program for security researchers
- Integration incentives for applications using TACo
- Community-voted initiatives and proposals

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 months)
- Announce TACo independence and token launch plans
- Release technical documentation for node operation
- Deploy testnet for operator preparation
- Conduct security audits of all smart contracts

### Phase 2: WorkLock 2.0 (1 month)
- Open ETH staking period for WorkLock participation
- Provide technical support for node setup
- Conduct KYC for larger participants if legally required

### Phase 3: Network Launch (1 month)
- Take snapshot of Threshold Network stakeholders
- Distribute initial tokens to WorkLock participants
- Begin operational requirements tracking
- Launch TACo mainnet with initial node set

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Development (Ongoing)
- Begin community governance of development fund
- Implement performance-based rewards
- Establish partnerships with key DeFi and Web3 projects
- Develop additional use cases for TACo

## Economic Sustainability

### Fee Structure
- Service fees paid in TACo tokens for encryption/decryption operations
- Fee tiers based on usage volume and complexity of access conditions
- Fee distribution: 70% to node operators, 20% to treasury, 10% token burn

### Staking Economics
- Minimum stake requirement: 10,000 TACo tokens per node
- Staking rewards: Base rate of 5-8% APR, with bonuses for performance
- Slashing penalties: Up to 10% for malicious behavior, 1-5% for downtime

### Treasury Management
- Conservative management of ETH from WorkLock
- Diversification into stablecoins for operational runway
- Transparent reporting of treasury activities

## Governance Structure

### Initial Governance
- Multi-sig governance during launch phases
- Composed of core team, community representatives, and technical experts
- Limited to critical security and parameter adjustments

### Transition to DAO
- Progressive decentralization over 12 months
- Token-weighted voting with delegation
- Proposal categories with different quorum requirements
- Timelock for major protocol changes

## Unique Advantages of This Approach

1. **Proven Foundation**: Builds on the successful WorkLock model that effectively bootstrapped NuCypher's network

2. **Technical Alignment**: Ensures token holders are also network contributors

3. **Fair Recognition**: Acknowledges both new participants and existing Threshold stakeholders

4. **Regulatory Consideration**: Focuses on work and network contribution rather than speculation

5. **Sustainable Economics**: Creates long-term alignment through vesting and operational requirements

## Conclusion

This fair launch proposal for TACo combines the best elements of NuCypher's WorkLock with modern token distribution practices. By prioritizing network security, broad distribution, and aligned incentives, TACo can establish itself as an independent protocol with strong community support and technical foundation.

The WorkLock 2.0 mechanism ensures that token distribution is tied to actual network participation, creating a robust foundation of node operators from day one. Combined with recognition for existing stakeholders and a substantial community development fund, this approach positions TACo for long-term success as a decentralized access control network.
